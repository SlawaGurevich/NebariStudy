# Nebari Study

## What is this?
NebariStudy is (or will be) a Kanji studying app for Android.

## Why does this exist?
For many years now, I have been struggling with studying Kanji for my JLPT tests. While the fist few levels require you to remember 80 (JLPT N1) or 300 (JLPT N2) kanjis, the last level (JLPT N1) requires you to literally remember thousands! To master all of them I was using StickyStudy on my iPhone (which is a great app, that I really recommend). However, then the unexpected happened and I switched to Android. For months now I have been looking for an app to help me study kanji, all the way carrying two phones with me, because I just couldn't find one on par with StickyStudy on the iPhone. Well, time to make my own app...

While I do like StickyStudy and would gladly continue to use it, I would also like to use something similar on my Android phone. Since there are no Apps that I liked on Android, I started my own. While many features are similar to StickyStudy, there are some features in particular, that I wanted to improve on. Just to name a few:

- create decks that could be shared online
- create themed decks, that can be assigned to a medium, for example 天気のこ (Movie) or 逆転裁判 (Game), that contain vocabulary from that medium
-  improve the study-interaction, since it always felt a little stiff to click buttons to pass or skip the kanji, so I felt that a more tinder swipe feel would help the learning processs
- ...

## Current state
The app is very much in a beta state right now and a ton of features are missing. I am making steady progress, but it will take some time, so this repo is primarily for demonstration purposes. Attached are a few screenshots from the current version.

## (Current) Features

- Create custom decks to store cards (can't add cards, yet, though)
- Look up lists for the different JLPT levels
- Look up kanji individually with translations and reading info
- Dictionary has basic functionality
